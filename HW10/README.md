In this assignment, I extended and complete the `powers` package we designed in class, making three more functions while add a throw error argument for the existing  `square()` function. It was pretty fun and not hard designing the functions, however, the uploading and documentation makes this homework a little bit complicated to me. Also, there are so many links showing in the documents, so hopefully, all of them work.

I went through the [instructor's note](http://stat545.com/cm109-110-notes_and_exercises.html) again, and create another whole repository in github for this function, and found it could work finally. I am a little bit confused about the difference between package README.md file and vignettes.rmd file. After searching the website, I found some experienced programmers suggest that they should be identical. You can find more details in this [link](https://community.rstudio.com/t/readme-md-vs-package-vignette-vs-package-documentation/1359/3).
