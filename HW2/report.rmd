## Prework

I make the libreary and some common variables which could be used throughout the project into the `lib.R` file, and use `source()` function to refer and take use of them.

```{r message=FALSE}
source("lib.R")
```


## Data Description

The `Forest Fires Dataset` was obtained from [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires). This dataset has 517 observations and 12 features. Detailed description of each feature could be obtained from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/forest-fires/forestfires.names)(Ref 1). 


## Data Glance

```{r results='asis'}
forestFire_head <- read.csv("forestFires.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",") %>%
	head(10)
knitr::kable(forestFire_head, digits = 2, align ="r", padding = 10)
```


## 1. Perform Exploratory Analysis 

#### Reorder the data by month

First, let's show the bar chart of number of forest fires within each month, with `month` unordered.

Then, let's show the bar chart of number of forest fires within each month, with `month` ordered.

</center>


#### Sort the month by total burned area within the month

Let's show the bar chart of total burned forest fires area within each month by another way.

</center>

```{r results='asis'}
fire_Month_Area_Ordered <- readRDS("fire_Month_Area_Ordered.rds")
knitr::kable(fire_Month_Area_Ordered, digits = 2, align ="r", padding = 10)
```



#### Save the reordered dataset for future use and explore the reordered effect

Let's see whether the levels of `ordered_fireDat.rds` is properly ordered.

```{r}
ordered_fireDat <- readRDS("ordered_fireDat.rds")
levels(ordered_fireDat$month)
levels(ordered_fireDat$day)
```

Both variables `month` and `day` are ordered properly, from `jan` to `dec` and from `sun` to `sat`, respectively. Good!


## 2. Perform Statistical Analyses

Now we are interested to see the how the weekly fire count trend varies by each month.

I built the following form of dataframe for the convinience of plotting using `ggplot`.

```{r, results = 'asis'}
fire_Day_Month_head <-
	readRDS("fire_Day_Month.rds") %>%
	head(15)
knitr::kable(fire_Day_Month_head, digits = 2, align ="r", padding = 10)
```

<center>
![](weeklyTrend.png){
width=80% }
</center>


#### Fit linear model and obtain the coef.s (area ~ wind)

We are now using the `ordered_fireDat` to do some other analysis. 

```{r results='asis'}
bestMonthAnalysis_head <- read.delim("bestMonthAnalysis.tsv") %>%
	head()
knitr::kable(bestMonthAnalysis_head, digits = 2, align ="r", padding = 10)
```

#### Select best month based on whose coefficients' are significant.

```{r results='asis'}
bestMonthRes <- read.delim("bestMonthRes.tsv") 
knitr::kable(bestMonthRes, digits = 2, align ="r", padding = 10)
```

It could be seen that the coefficients of apr are significant, which means are not likely to be 0. In other words, for the dataset belong to apr, there might exist a relationship of area ~ wind. 


## 3. Generate Figures

#### Create a figure for each relative humidity levels.

According to the median of relative humidity levels (variable `RH`), I categorize `RH` into two levels, one is below median, one is above median. After that, I did the linear fit and calculate the coefficient estimates. Below is my results:

```{r results='asis'}
coef_FireDat <- read.delim("coefFireDat.tsv") 
knitr::kable(coef_FireDat, digits = 2, align ="r", padding = 10)
```

<center>
![](lmComparison.png){
width=80% }
</center>

From the results of coefficients table and the above graph, there is some linear relationship between fire burned area and the wind speed when the relative humidity level is low.
