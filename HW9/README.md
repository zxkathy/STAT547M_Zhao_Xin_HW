## Features of power package

This package contains 4 functions in total: 

- squre(): take the square of a vector; 

- boxcox(): take the boxcox transformations of a vector,

- boxcox.inv(): take the inverse boxcox transformations of a vector, `boxcox()` dependency
    
- na.filter(): filter out NA values by row or columns in a dataset, whether `row` or `col` should be specified by the user

## Report your progress

In this assignment, I extended and complete the `powers` package we designed in class, making three more functions while add a throw error argument for the existing  `square()` function. It was pretty fun and not hard designing the functions, however, the uploading and documentation makes this homework a little bit complicated to me.
