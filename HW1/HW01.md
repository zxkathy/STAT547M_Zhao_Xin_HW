Task 1. Character data
----------------------

#### 14.2.5 Exercises

Q1(a): In code that doesn’t use stringr, you’ll often see paste() and paste0(). What’s the difference between the two functions?

A1(a): Default value of sep with `paste` function is `sep = " "`, and default value of sep with `paste0` function is `sep = ""`. By default, `paste0` has no separator and output single charactor.

``` r
paste("a", "b", "c")
```

    ## [1] "a b c"

``` r
paste0("a", "b", "c")
```

    ## [1] "abc"

From the following example, we can see paste0 can put the strings together and then add the sep element.

``` r
paste(rep("student", 4), rep("number", 4), seq(1,4,1), sep = "_", collapse = ", ")
```

    ## [1] "student_number_1, student_number_2, student_number_3, student_number_4"

``` r
paste0(rep("student", 4), rep("number", 4), seq(1,4,1), sep = "_", collapse = ", ")
```

    ## [1] "studentnumber1_, studentnumber2_, studentnumber3_, studentnumber4_"

Q1(b): What stringr function are they equivalent to?

A1(b): `paste0` and `paste` are equivalent to function of `str_c`.

``` r
str_c("a", "b", "c")
```

    ## [1] "abc"

Q1(c): How do the functions differ in their handling of NA?

A1(c): `paste` recognizes `NA` as character element by default, while `str_c` recognizes NA as null element.

``` r
x <- c("a", NA, "c")
paste(x)
```

    ## [1] "a"  "NA" "c"

``` r
str_c(x)
```

    ## [1] "a" NA  "c"

``` r
str_c(str_replace_na(x))
```

    ## [1] "a"  "NA" "c"

Q2: In your own words, describe the difference between the sep and collapse arguments to str\_c().

A2: When your input is several vectors, sep is the what you put in between ith element of vectors, collapse is what you put in betwen new combined new strings.

``` r
str_c(rep("student", 4), rep("number", 4), seq(1,4,1), sep = "_")
```

    ## [1] "student_number_1" "student_number_2" "student_number_3"
    ## [4] "student_number_4"

``` r
str_c(rep("student", 4), rep("number", 4), seq(1,4,1), sep = "_", collapse = ", ")
```

    ## [1] "student_number_1, student_number_2, student_number_3, student_number_4"

Q3: Use str\_length() and str\_sub() to extract the middle character from a string. What will you do if the string has an even number of characters?

A3: I decide to output the middle two characters if the string has an even number of characters.

``` r
x <- "abcde"
y <- "abcd"
str_sub(x, (str_length(x)+1)/2, -(str_length(x)+1)/2)
```

    ## [1] "c"

``` r
str_sub(y, (str_length(y)+1)/2, -(str_length(y)+1)/2)
```

    ## [1] "bc"

Q4: What does str\_wrap() do? When might you want to use it?

A4: When we have long paragraphs, `str_wrap()` can format them.

``` r
x <- "abcde desd"
y <- "abcd sfewf ada"
str_wrap(c(x,y), width = 3, indent = 0, exdent = 0)
```

    ## [1] "abcde\ndesd"      "abcd\nsfewf\nada"

What does str\_trim() do? What’s the opposite of str\_trim()?

Write a function that turns (e.g.) a vector c("a", "b", "c") into the string a, b, and c. Think carefully about what it should do if given a vector of length 0, 1, or 2. \#\# Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
